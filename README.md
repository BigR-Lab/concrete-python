You will need the Python 'pdoc' module to regenerate the
documentation.  pdoc can be installed using pip.

BEWARE: pdoc will use the docstrings from the version of
concrete-python that is loaded using:

    import concrete

which MAY BE DIFFERENT than the version of concrete-python in the
'master' branch of this Git repository.

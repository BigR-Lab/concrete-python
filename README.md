Concrete - Python
=================

This repository contains Python modules and scripts for working with
[Concrete](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete), an HLT data
specification defined using [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org).

This repository contains the Python classes generated by the Thrift
compiler, but does not contain the .thrift definition files that were
used to generate these classes.  The .thrift definition files can be
found in the Concrete GitHub repository: https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete
You do not need to install the Thrift compiler to use this library.


Requirements
------------

Concrete-Python requires the following:
* Python >= 2.7.x
* 'networkx' Python package
* 'thrift' Python package >= 0.9.1

Installation
------------

You can install Concrete using the pip package manager:

    pip install git+https://github.com/charman/concrete-python.git#egg=concrete

or by cloning this repository and running setup.py:

    git clone https://github.com/charman/concrete-python.git
    cd concrete-python
    python setup.py test
    python setup.py install


Using the code in your project
------------------------------

Compiled Python classes end up in the `concrete` namespace. You can
use them by importing them as follows:

```python
from concrete.communication import *
from concrete.communication.ttypes import *

foo = Communication()
foo.text = 'hello world'
...
```

Concrete - Python
=================

Python modules and scripts for working with
[Concrete](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete), an HLT data
specification defined using [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org).

This repository contains the Python classes generated by the Thrift
compiler, but not the .thrift definition files that were used to
generate these classes.  The .thrift definition files can be found in
the Concrete GitHub repository: https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete

Requirements
------------

Concrete-Python requires the following:
* Python >= 2.7.x
* 'networkx' Python package
* 'thrift' Python package >= 0.9.1
You do not need to install the Thrift compiler to use this library.

Installation
------------

You can install Concrete using the pip package manager:

    pip install git+https://github.com/charman/concrete-python.git#egg=concrete

or by cloning this repository and running setup.py:

    git clone https://github.com/charman/concrete-python.git
    cd concrete-python
    python setup.py test
    python setup.py install

Useful Scripts
--------------

The Concrete Python package comes with two scripts.

**concrete2json.py** reads in a Concrete Communication and prints a
JSON version of the Communication to stdout.  The JSON is "pretty
printed" with indentation and whitespace, which makes the JSON easier
to read and to use for diffs.

**validate_communication.py** reads in a Concrete Communication file
and prints out information about any invalid fields.  This script is a
command-line wrapper around the functionality in the
`concrete.validate` library.

Use the '-h/--help' flag for details about the scripts' command line
arguments.


Using the code in your project
------------------------------

Compiled Python classes end up in the `concrete` namespace. You can
use them by importing them as follows:

```python
from concrete import Communication

foo = Communication()
foo.text = 'hello world'
...
```
